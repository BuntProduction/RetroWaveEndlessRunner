Retro Wave Run is my first ever Android Video Game. It's an endless runner done with Unity 3D in C#. The project has been finished in march 2021.
You can download the project to test it on unity or simply download the app on your android mobile by searching "Retro Wave Run" on Playstore or by clicking this link : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BuntProduction.RetroWaveRun&gl=FR
It Took me 200 hours to learn Unity and C# and to finish this project. This is not a perfect project but this is my own video game and i am really proud of ! 
I am open to tips for the next time !
